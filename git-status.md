# Definition: git status

The git status provides a view of the current state of the repository and staging area in a Git repository. 

It is useful to track the state of files within the repository and to find out which files are untracked if there are any.

This command can be accessed in Jupyter Lab with looking at the Git tab avaible. It will provide a graphical view of the same information the terminal would provide.
